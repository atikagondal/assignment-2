Assignment 2: Machine Learning

I chose to work with case two. 
I researched a few places such as https://www.alpharithms.com/predicting-stock-prices-with-linear-regression-214618/, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9404733/ and a few youtube videoes. and then came to the conclusion that linear regression might be the best option. 
Linear regression was the best option because it make sit easier for a buyer/trader to identify price points easier, such as stop-loss price and exit prices. It also provides a clearer point of view by discovering pattern; it can detect specific price patterns on particular days or at certain times. Insights gathered from regression analysis can help tradersanticipate times when the stocks will be in demand, and then they wont.
